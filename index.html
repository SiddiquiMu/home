            <h1>What Is The Cosmos?</h1>
            <p>
                The cosmos is a vast and mysterious vaccum that has fascinated humanity for centuries. 
                It contains all of space, time, matter, and energy,
                and contains infinite galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. 
                Despite our scientific advances, a lot of the cosmos remains unexplored and unknown.
                The study of the cosmos also raises a variety of philosophical questions. 
                What is the meaning of life in such an incomprehensible universe? 
                Are we alone, or are there other intelligent beings out there?
                These are questions that have fascinated philosophers and scientists alike, 
                and continue to inspire wonder in us all.

            <h1>The Big Bang</h1>
            <p>    
            The Big Bang is a scientific theory on how the universe came into existence.
            It states that the universe began as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature,
            and then expanded rapidly about 13.8 billion years ago.
            This set the stage for the formation of galaxies, stars, and eventually, life.

            <h1>Time Dilation</h1>
            <p>    
            Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs when time appears to move slower for objects that are moving relative to an observer.
            According to the theory of relativity, the faster an object moves, the slower time appears to pass for that object. 
            This means that time for an object or person traveling at near the speed of light will pass much slower than for a stationary person. 
            </p>
            <h1>Aliens?</h1>
            <p>
                Since humans discovered space and its emptiness. They've wondered if there are any others out there on other planets. 
                Some people even think the governments are hiding extreterrestrial beings from the public. Many people believe that aliens would be hostile if they were to interact with humanity.
                Others believe they would come in peace.

            <h1>Black Holes</h1>
            <h2>What Do They Look Like?</h2>
            <p>
                The appearance of a blackhole is quite difficult to describe and its quite a marvel but also scary when you first see it.
                They really only have a ring of colour and the inside seems to be a void but really it is a wormhole to another point in space.
